## `git reset`
The `git reset` command is used to undo changes in your repository. It can modify the state of your working directory, staging area (index), and commit history. This command is powerful and should be used with caution, as it can overwrite or discard changes.
#### Syntax:
```bash
git reset [mode] [commit]
```
- **`[mode]`:** Determines how the reset is performed. Common modes are `--soft`, `--mixed`, and `--hard`.
- **`[commit]`:** The commit to reset to (default is HEAD).
