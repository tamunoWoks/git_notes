## git pull
The git pull command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and integrate them into your local branch. Itâ€™s essentially a combination of two commands: git fetch (to download changes) and git merge (to integrate them into your local branch). This is how you keep your local repository up to date with the remote repository.
