## `git diff`
The git diff command is used to show differences between various states of your repository. It can compare changes between:
- The working directory and the staging area (index).
- The staging area and the latest commit.
- Two commits or branches.
- Specific files or directories.  

This command is incredibly useful for reviewing changes before committing or merging.
